For this alpha, we implemented Hangman in both evil and good forms. 

Here are some things we plan to do for the release:
- Improve the algorithm for speed
- keep track of high scores
- tell user that what the word was 
- alert error if user has guessed a given letter already (and don't decrease number of guesses left)
- multiple images to visually show hangman gameplay
- Alert user of what word actually was if they lost
- Alert for invalid word length - self.Good = [[GoodGamePlay alloc] init];
- Make sure settings values = model values
