For the release, we have fully implemented Hangman in both Good & Evil forms (divided into two models that both extend from standard GamePlay).  We are also keeping track of the user's high score History.

For the evil mode, hangman evaluates each equivalence class and picks the one with the most words.  When faced with equivalence classes of equal contents, Evil chooses randomly.

Since the alpha, we have more greatly restricted user input to just alphabetical characters.  The user is not allowed to guess a letter they have already guessed.  Upon the end of a game (a lose), we now inform the user of the word they neglected to guess.  

Twenty-six images show Hangman game play up to the greatest possible # of wrong guesses (26).  When a user plays with less than 26 guesses, the images are divided into larger increments (i.e. displaying image #1, then #4, then #7 rather than just numbers 1, 2, & 3).  That way, a user who plays with only two or three wrong guesses will still be able to see the man hanged.

As a note, we clear the text box when user enters invalid input, but when the user enters a correct letter we leave it in the text box as a memory of what letter was just guessed.  When the user clicks on the text box to enter a new letter, it automatically clears last turn's guess.

Also, on testing, please look at Project2LogicTests. 

Thanks!
