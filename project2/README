For this alpha, we implemented Hangman in both evil and good forms. 
We decided that in evil mode the hangman will evaluate each equivalence class and pick the one with the most words. 

Here are some things we plan to do for the release:
- Improve the algorithm for speed.  Right now, evil hangs a bit.  We can probably do more to free up memory
- keep track of high scores
- tell user that what the word was 
- alert error if user has guessed a given letter already (and don't decrease number of guesses left)
- multiple images to visually show hangman gameplay
